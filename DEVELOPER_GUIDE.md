# Developer Guide

## Setup

```sh
make toolchain # Install required to develop the project
```

## Testing a code change

Deploy your changes to a local development cluster and run the tests against it. You will need to allowlist your account
for ENI trunking before the deployment.

```sh
make apply-dependencies # install the cert manager and certificate
make apply # Apply your changes
make e2etest # Run the integration test suite
```

In another terminal, you can tail the logs with stern
```sh
stern -l app=vpc-resource-controller -n kube-system
```

## Submitting a PR
Run the presubmit target and check in all generated code before submitting a PR.

```sh
make presubmit
```
